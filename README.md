# CredNITT

CredNITT is a digital wallet platform and online credit system to power in-app and tap-to-pay
purchases on campus, enabling users to make deferred payments seamlessly, with the college
acting as an aggregator between the shops and the users. It also acts as an expense tracker with a simple yet effective UI.
